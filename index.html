<h1>Introduction to Coral Reefs</h1>
  <h2>Why Study the Ocean?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Approximately 70% of Earth is covered by ocean.</strong>
      <br>The Earth's surface is 71% water and 29% land. Of that 71%, 97% is found in the oceans. The remaining 3% is either locked up in the ice caps and glaciers, or is found in fresh water bodies.</li>
    <li><strong>230 thousand species have been recorded in the sea. There may be an estimated 1-10 million in total!</strong>
      <br>A huge number of species and taxonomic groups live in the sea. It’s thought the majority of which could be undiscovered, but are nonetheless important for ecological functioning and could hold the key to important scientific breakthroughs.</li>
    <li><strong>10-12% of humans depend on fishing and aquaculture for income.</strong>
    <br>Aquaculture is the harvesting of marine resources, e.g. seaweed or shellfish.</li>
    <li><strong>Many products (e.g. medicine) come from the sea.</strong>
    <br>Coral reefs in particular have very complex ways of protecting themselves from the reef, so there is a lot of interest in them from the medical industry.</li>
    <li><strong>We have only explored around 5% of the oceans.</strong>
    <br>As oceans make up most of the Earth’s crust, this means that most of the world remains unexplored and therefore a mystery!</li>
    <li><strong>The marine ecosystem connects with the land ecosystem to form a 'global ecosystem'.</strong>
    <br>The world is a highly connected place. What happens in the ocean effects what happens on the land. For example, fish get eaten by birds. Birds get eaten by land carnivores.</li>
    <li><strong>...And because it is UNDER THREAT.</strong>
    <br>The oceans are under assault from an array of anthropogenic disturbances. These include climate change, overfishing, ocean acidification and plastic pollution. There has never been a more important time to support marine conservation!</li>

    <h2>Key Terms in Ecology</h2>
    <p><strong>Ecosystem - </strong>Network of interactions between organisms</p>
    <p><strong>Habitat - </strong>Environment where organisms live</p>
    <p><strong>Community - </strong>All organisms co-existing within a habitat</p>
    <p><strong>Population - </strong>All members within a single species</p>
    <p><strong>Niche - </strong>A role within an ecosystem</p>
    <p><strong>Function - </strong>A benefit provided to the ecosystem</p>
    <p><strong>Service - </strong>A benefit provided to humans</p>
    <p><strong>Pelagic - </strong>Water column</p>
    <p><strong>Benthic - </strong>Bottom-dwelling</p>
    <p><strong>Plankton - </strong>Floating</p>
    <p><strong>Nekton - </strong>Swimming</p>
    <p><strong>Sessile - </strong>Stationary</p>
    <p><strong>Motile - </strong>Free-moving</p>

    <h2>What is a Reef?</h2>
    <p>A reef is a structure that provides relief on the seafloor and a barrier to water movement. Reefs were relevant to sailors long before they were studied by scientists as they had to be careful to navigate them successfully. The term comes from the norse term <em>'rif'</em> which means hazardous <em>'rib'</em> close to the surface of the sea. Reefs can be...

      <br>
      <strong>natural (e.g.)...</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Coral</li>
        <li>Rock</li>
        <li>Calcified algae</li>
    </ul>
    <strong> or artificial (e.g.)...</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Shipwreck</li>
      <li>Cement blocks</li>
    </ul>
    The majority of sea life can't survive for too long on an open sand back because they are vulnerable to getting swept about or being easily eatern by predators.

    <h2>What is Coral?</h2>
    <p>Coral is made of a colony of animal components called <strong>polyps</strong>. We group corals into two types. Hard corals and soft corals. Hard corals are responsible for establishing long-lasting reef structures. They have hard calcium carbonate skeletons that stay preserved after the polyps die. This enables new generations to build on top of dead ones, meaning large reef structures can build up over many years.</p>

     <h2>Latitudinal Zones</h2>
    <p><strong>Tropical Seas</strong>
      <br>The water temperature is warm - over 18 degrees celsius. There is little fluctuation of conditions making it very stable for life.</p>
    <p><strong>Temperate Seas</strong>
      <br>Temperatures range from 10 to 18 degrees celsius. These regions are highly seasonal. In the winter months, the seas are often rough. This increases the mixing of nutrients that causes blooms of plankton at certain times of year.</p>
    <p><strong>Polar Seas</strong>
      <br>The waters here are under 10 degrees celsius. Ice often forms on the ocean surface. Animals living here need adaptations to prevent their bodies from feeding.</p>

    <h2>Importance for Nature</h2>
    <p>
      Coral reefs contain the most <strong>biodiversity</strong> of any ecosystem. They occupy less than 1% of the sea floor, but contain around one quarter of all sea life. This is due to the structural support provided by the coral itself. This acts as good shelter for fish and other organisms to thrive in. It also provides good anchorage for other organisms to grow on top of. This provides food for the fish. As the population of fish thrive, this brings in predators that eat the fish. The result is a rich flourising ecosystem. The animal kingdom is grouped into 36 phyla. Nine can be found in tropical rainforests. Coral reefs harbor 32.
      Coral reefs also connect with other ecosystems. Some species migrate into and out of a coral reef for feeding purposes or cleaning services. This means that if the reef suffers, these animals may perish and the other habitats that they travel to will also be affected. Additionally, a lot of the biomass from coral reefs trickle down to feed life in deeper parts of the ocean where food is more scarce.

    <h2>Services for Humans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Food</strong>
        <br>Coral reefs are a major food source for up to one billion people. (Estimates vary according to sources.) Approximately 6 million people directly catch fish on reefs.</li>
      <li><strong>Tourism</strong>
        <br>Tourism around reefs comes in the form of diving, snorkelling, beach generation, sea food and more. Tourism from coral reefs is estimated to produce around $36 billion globally per year.</li>
      <li><strong>Coastal Protection</strong>
        <br>Coral reefs act as a very important barrier against waves and erosion. Reefs dissipate up to 97% of wave energy. This is significant because without them, coastal erosion and destruction, including damage to human structures on the coast, would be high. It is estimated that the presence of reefs saves the global economy from more than $4 billion worth of damage from coastal erosion per year.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Resources</strong>
        <br>Reefs also harbour other substances that are important or luxurious for humans. These include medicines, stock for the aquarium trade and building resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural significance for many communities</strong>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All in all, coral reefs are estimated to produce around $30 billion per year for the global economy!</strong></p>
