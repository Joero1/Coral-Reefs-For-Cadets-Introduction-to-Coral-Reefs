    <li><strong>230 thousand species have been recorded in the sea.</strong>There may be an estimated 1-10 million in total!</li>
    <li><strong>10-12% of humans depend on fishing and aquaculture for income.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Many products (e.g. medicine) come from the sea.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>We have only explored around 5% of the oceans.</strong></li>
