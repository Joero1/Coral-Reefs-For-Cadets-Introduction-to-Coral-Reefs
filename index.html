<h1>Introduction to Coral Reefs</h1>

  <div>
    <h2>What is a Reef?</h2>
    <p>A reef is a structure that provides relief on the seafloor and a barrier to water movement. Reefs were relevant to sailors long before they were studied by scientists as they had to be careful to navigate them successfully. The term comes from the norse term <em>'rif'</em> which means hazardous <em>'rib'</em> close to the surface of the sea. Reefs can be...

      <br>
      <strong>natural (e.g.)...</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Coral</li>
        <li>Rock</li>
        <li>Calcified algae</li>
    </ul>
    <strong> or artificial (e.g.)...</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Shipwreck</li>
      <li>Cement blocks</li>
    </ul>
    The majority of sea life can't survive for too long on an open sand back because they are vulnerable to getting swept about or being easily eatern by predators.

    <h2>What is Coral?</h2>
    <p>Coral is made of a colony of animal components called <strong>polyps</strong>. We group corals into two types. Hard corals and soft corals. Hard corals are responsible for establishing long-lasting reef structures. They have hard calcium carbonate skeletons that stay preserved after the polyps die. This enables new generations to build on top of dead ones, meaning large reef structures can build up over many years. Corals also contain <strong>zooxanthellae</strong>. This is a type of tiny photosynthetic algae that makes food and therefore energy that gets used by the coral.</p>

     <h2>Where Do (Most) Corals Thrive?</h2>
  <h3>We can divide the oceans into three latitudinal zones.</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tropical Seas</strong>
      <br>The water temperature is warm - over 18 degrees celsius. There is little fluctuation of conditions making it very stable for life.</li>
    <li><strong>Temperate Seas</strong>
      <br>Temperatures range from 10 to 18 degrees celsius. These regions are highly seasonal. In the winter months, the seas are often rough. This increases the mixing of nutrients that causes blooms of plankton at certain times of year.</li>
    <li><strong>Polar Seas</strong>
      <br>The waters here are under 10 degrees celsius. Ice often forms on the ocean surface. Animals living here need adaptations to prevent their bodies from feeding.</li>
    <h3>Photosynthetic coral reefs can only thrive in certain conditions. They need...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Warm temperatues all year round.</strong>
        <br>Their optimum temperature ranges from 23 to 29 degrees celsius.</li>
      <li><strong>A lot of sunlight</strong>
        <br>This is because corals get their energy from tiny photosynthetic organisms that grow on them called zooxanthellae. This process involves the use of sunlight to produce food for the coral. For this reason, coral reefs are generally restricted to the top 60 meters of the sea.</li>
      <li><strong>'Oligotrophic' waters</strong>
        <br>This means waters with low nutrient levels. This may seem surprising. The reason is because coral is rather slow growing. If there is a high level of nutrients in the water, it will get quickly consumed by algae (a.k.a. seaweed) and this will grow rapidly outgrow and overtake the coral. It will take up space, blockout sunlight and use up much of the oxygen. All these factors will reduce the health and growth of coral.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Because of these requirements, photosynthetic coral reefs are restricted to shallow tropical waters, generally within 30 degrees north or south of the equator.</strong></p>
    <p>There are exceptions however. There are deep sea and cold water corals that can sometimes be found as deep as over 2,000m. They do not recieve sunlight and therefore have no zooxanthellae. They feed by catching small particles of organic matter falling from shallower water. The communities of organisms that deep sea reefs harbour are very different to those of tropical phosotynthetic reefs.</p>
    <h3>Reef Community Hubs</h3>
    <p>There are three 'hotspots' of tropical reef communities. They are the Caribbean, the Red Sea and the Indo-Pacific. The most biodiverse reefs in the world are found in the Indo-Pacific. This is due to a number of factors. For one thing, it is fed by biological communities from multiple oceans and land masses. The reefs here therefore recieve a lot of geographical overlap. Additionally, the seas here recieve an optimum amount of disturbance. The Caribbean recieves stronger and more severe storms, and this can inhibit the flourishing of wildlife. In contrast, the Red Sea receives very little rough weather. Surprisingly, this can also lower the diversity because a certain amount of stormy weather can help to restore the balance of nature by preventing certain species from dominating at the expense of others.</p>

    <h2>Importance for Nature</h2>
    <p>
      Coral reefs contain the most <strong>biodiversity</strong> of any ecosystem. They occupy less than 1% of the sea floor, but contain around one quarter of all sea life. This is due to the structural support provided by the coral itself. This acts as good shelter for fish and other organisms to thrive in. It also provides good anchorage for other organisms to grow on top of. This provides food for the fish. As the population of fish thrive, this brings in predators that eat the fish. The result is a rich flourising ecosystem. The animal kingdom is grouped into 36 phyla. Nine can be found in tropical rainforests. Coral reefs harbor 32.
      Coral reefs also connect with other ecosystems. Some species migrate into and out of a coral reef for feeding purposes or cleaning services. This means that if the reef suffers, these animals may perish and the other habitats that they travel to will also be affected. Additionally, a lot of the biomass from coral reefs trickle down to feed life in deeper parts of the ocean where food is more scarce.

    <h2>Importance for Humans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Food</strong>
        <br>Coral reefs are a major food source for up to one billion people. (Estimates vary according to sources.) Approximately 6 million people directly catch fish on reefs.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Tourism</strong>
        <br>Tourism around reefs comes in the form of diving, snorkelling, beach generation, sea food and more. Tourism from coral reefs is estimated to produce around $36 billion globally per year.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Coastal Protection</strong>
        <br>Coral reefs act as a very important barrier against waves and erosion. Reefs dissipate up to 97% of wave energy. This is significant because without them, coastal erosion and destruction, including damage to human structures on the coast, would be high. It is estimated that the presence of reefs saves the global economy from more than $4 billion worth of damage from coastal erosion per year.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Other Resources</strong>
        <br>Reefs also harbour other substances that are important or luxurious for humans. These include medicines, stock for the aquarium trade and building resources.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Cultural significance for many communities</strong>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All in all, coral reefs are estimated to produce around $30 billion per year for the global economy!</strong></p>
