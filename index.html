<h1>Introduction to Coral Reefs</h1>
  <h2>Why Study the Ocean?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Approximately 70% of Earth is covered by ocean.</strong>
      <br>The Earth's surface is 71% water and 29% land. Of that 71%, 97% is found in the oceans. The remaining 3% is either locked up in the ice caps and glaciers, or is found in fresh water bodies.</li>
    <li><strong>230 thousand species have been recorded in the sea. There may be an estimated 1-10 million in total!</strong>
      <br>A huge number of species and taxonomic groups live in the sea. It’s thought the majority of which could be undiscovered, but are nonetheless important for ecological functioning and could hold the key to important scientific breakthroughs.</li>
    <li><strong>10-12% of humans depend on fishing and aquaculture for income.</strong>
    <br>Aquaculture is the harvesting of marine resources, e.g. seaweed or shellfish.</li>
    <li><strong>Many products (e.g. medicine) come from the sea.</strong>
    <br>Coral reefs in particular have very complex ways of protecting themselves from the reef, so there is a lot of interest in them from the medical industry.</li>
    <li><strong>We have only explored around 5% of the oceans.</strong>
    <br>As oceans make up most of the Earth’s crust, this means that most of the world remains unexplored and therefore a mystery!</li>
    <li><strong>The marine ecosystem connects with the land ecosystem to form a 'global ecosystem'.</strong>
    <br>The world is a highly connected place. What happens in the ocean effects what happens on the land. For example, fish get eaten by birds. Birds get eaten by land carnivores.</li>
    <li><strong>...And because it is UNDER THREAT.</strong>
    <br>The oceans are under assault from an array of anthropogenic disturbances. These include climate change, overfishing, ocean acidification and plastic pollution. There has never been a more important time to support marine conservation!</li>

    <h2>Key Terms in Ecology</h2>
    <p><strong>Ecosystem - </strong>Network of interactions between organisms</p>
    <p><strong>Habitat - </strong>Environment where organisms live</p>
    <p><strong>Community - </strong>All organisms co-existing within a habitat</p>
    <p><strong>Population - </strong>All members within a single species</p>
    <p><strong>Niche - </strong>A role within an ecosystem</p>
    <p><strong>Function - </strong>A benefit provided to the ecosystem</p>
    <p><strong>Service - </strong>A benefit provided to humans</p>
    <p><strong>Pelagic - </strong>Water column</p>
    <p><strong>Benthic - </strong>Bottom-dwelling</p>
    <p><strong>Plankton - </strong>Floating</p>
    <p><strong>Nekton - </strong>Swimming</p>
    <p><strong>Sessile - </strong>Stationary</p>
    <p><strong>Motile - </strong>Free-moving</p>

    <h2>Latitudinal Zones</h2>
    <p><strong>Tropical Seas</strong>
      <br>The water temperature is warm - over 18 degrees celsius. There is little fluctuation of conditions making it very stable for life.</p>
    <p><strong>Temperate Seas</strong>
      <br>Temperatures range from 10 to 18 degrees celsius. These regions are highly seasonal. In the winter months, the seas are often rough. This increases the mixing of nutrients that causes blooms of plankton at certain times of year.</p>
    <p><strong>Polar Seas</strong>
      <br>The waters here are under 10 degrees celsius. Ice often forms on the ocean surface. Animals living here need adaptations to prevent their bodies from feeding.</p>

    <h2>What is a Reef?</h2>
    <p>A reef is a structure that provides relief on the seafloor and a barrier to water movement. Reefs were relevant to sailors long before they were studied by scientists as they had to be careful to navigate them successfully. The term comes from the norse term <em>'rif'</em> which means hazardous <em>'rib'</em> close to the surface of the sea.
      <br>Reefs can be...
      <br><strong>natural (e.g.)...</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Coral</li>
        <li>Rock</li>
        <li>Calcified algae</li>
    </ul>
    <strong> or artificial (e.g.)...</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Shipwreck</li>
      <li>Cement blocks</li>
    </ul>
    The majority of sea life can't survive for too long on an open sand back because they are vulnerable to getting swept about or being easily eatern by predators.
