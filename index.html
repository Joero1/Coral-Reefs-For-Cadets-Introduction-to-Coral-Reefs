  INTRODUCTION &nbspTO &nbspCORAL &nbspREEFS
  </h1>
  </div>
  
  <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;">
    Coral reefs are arguably the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. They are sometimes described as being like underwater 'cities' for marine life.
    To fully appreciate them requires some understanding of their importance for both nature and for humans, and the extensive networks of interactions between the organisms that live their.

    <h2>What is a Reef?</h2>
    <p>A reef is a structure that provides relief on the seafloor and a barrier to water movement. Reefs were relevant to sailors long before they were studied by scientists 
      as they had to be carefully navigated on voyages. The word comes from the norse term <em>'rif'</em> which means a hazardous <em>'rib'</em> close to the surface of the
      sea. Reefs can be...</p>

    <br><br><p align="right">...or <strong>artificial</strong> (e.g. a shipwreck or blocks placed to attract wildlife or induce waves for surfing).</p>
  <br><br><p style="text-align: center;">  
  The majority of marine organisms are not well adapted for survival on open sand banks. Things that grow on the seafloor are more likely to get swooshed about and animals that 
    swim are more exposed to predators. This is why reefs support a much greater abundance of wildlife. They provide a stable structure for benthic organisms to grow. 
    This in turn provides more food and shelter for even more organisms. Soon an entire complex food web builds up across the reef.

    <h2>What is Coral?</h2>
    <p>Coral is made of a colony of animal components called <strong>polyps</strong>, all living together in a single structure. They come in many different shapes, and 
      their variety greatly contributes to the structural complexity on the reef. This is important because it opens up a range of microhabitats that can support many different organisms.</p>
    <p>We can broadly group corals into two types. <strong>Hard corals</strong> (sometimes called 'stony' or 'scleractinian' corals) have rock-like skeletons (here referring to their 'housing')
    of calcium carbonate that stay preserved long after the polyps die. In contrast, <strong>soft corals</strong> only possess a small amount of calcium carbonate and will
      therefore sway with the water movement and their structures will not preserve for long after polyp death. 
      The preservation of hard coral structures enables new generations of corals to build on top of dead ones, meaning that large reef 
      structures can build up over millenia. Most established coral reefs are between five thousand and ten thousand years old! </p> 
    <p>Corals in sunlit waters also have a symbiotic relationship with <strong>zooxanthellae</strong>. 
      This is a tiny photosynthetic algae that lives embedded on the outer tissue of the coral and supplies it with food and energy.
    The zooxanthellae contain pigments that absorb certain parts of the light spectrum. This provides corals with the spectacular array of colours that we see on the reef.</p>

     <h2>Where Do (Most) Corals Thrive?</h2>
                            <img align="right" style="padding-left:40px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="coralReefMap.jpg" height="380" width="700">  
    <p>Photosynthetic coral reefs can only flourish in certain conditions. They need...</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Warm temperatures all year round</strong><br>
        The optimum temperature for photosynthetic corals ranges from 23 to 29<sup>o</sup>C. If the temperature is too low or too high, photosynthesis will be inhibited and the coral will die within weeks.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>High sunlight</strong><br>
      This is required for photosynthesis to supply food for the coral. For this reason, coral reefs are generally restricted to clear waters in the top 60 meters.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Low nutrient waters</strong><br>
      We call these 'oligotrophic' waters. Corals need these because they are relatively slow growing organisms. If there is a high abundance of nutrients in the water, the nutrients will get rapidly get consumed by organisms that are much faster-growing, particularly algae, and this will quickly outgrow and outcompete the coral in the area. 
      It will take up space, blockout sunlight and use up much of the oxygen. All these factors will reduce the abundance, growth and health of the coral.</p>
    <p>Because of these particular requirements, photosynthetic coral reefs are restricted to shallow tropical waters, generally within 30 degrees north or south of the equator.</p> 
    <br>
    <img src="deepSeaCoral2.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 40px;" height="150" width="250">
    <h3 style="font-size: 19px;">Deep Sea Reefs</h3>
    <p>There are exceptions however. Deep sea and cold water corals can be found in waters as deep as over 2,000m. They do not recieve any sunlight and therefore have no zooxanthellae. They obtain their food mostly by catching small particles of organic matter that fall from the sunlit waters above. 
      The communities of organisms that deep sea reefs harbour are very different to those of tropical phosotynthetic reefs, but are nonetheless important and spectacular.

    <h2>Importance for Nature</h2>
        <img height=280" width="490" align="left" style="padding-right: 30px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="importanceForNature.jpg">
    <p>
      To put the extreme biodversity of coral reefs into context, consider the following. The animal kingdom is grouped into 36 phyla. Nine of which can be found in tropical rainforests. Thirty-two can be found on coral reefs!
      As a habitat, coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the sea floor, but contain around one quarter of all marine life.</p> 
      <p>This is in part due to the warm and stable conditions that make them suitable for life to thrive without having to deal with frequent and drastic weather changes. It is also due to the physical framework provided by the coral. 
      The structural complexity of coral provides good anchorage for other benthic organisms and serves as shelter for fish and other pelagic (swimming) organisms. 
      As more living things take refuge on the reef, their predators soon follow. 
      Sometimes both predator and prey species will obtain parasites on their bodies. These parasites do them no good but serve as food for 'cleaner' organisms that receive most of their nutrients by picking out the parasites from other organisms.
      The end result is a rich and flourising ecosystem with lots of complex interactions between living things. The community exists in a delicate balance. 
      If the population of one species changes, this can have substantial consequences for other species. 
      </p>
      <p>Coral reefs also connect with other ecosystems. Some species migrate into and out of the reef for feeding or cleaning purposes. 
      This means that if the reef suffers, these animals may perish and the other habitats that they connect with will also be affected. 
      Coral reefs are also important for supplying food to habitats much deeper down. Much of the biomass from the reef trickles down to feed deep sea life where photosynthesis cannot happen and therefore food is more scarce.

    <h2>Importance for Humans</h2>
   <img height="320" width="500" align="right" style="padding-left: 60px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="importanceForHumans.webp">
    <p>Some people dismiss the importance of protecting coral reefs because they see it as prioritising wildlife over human wellbeing. They are highly misinformed! The prosperity of many human societies is very closely tied to the fait of the reef for a number of reasons...
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Food</strong><br>
      Coral reefs are a major food source for up to one billion people. (Estimates vary according to sources.) Approximately 6 million people catch fish on the reefs directly.
      These fish provide a key source of protein for many families, particularly in developing countries. Much of it gets sold at markets. Catching and/or selling reef fish is therefore also a predominant form of employment for both men and women in many communities across the tropics. </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Tourism</strong><br>
      Tourism around reefs comes in the form of diving, snorkelling, beach generation, sea food and more. 
      The very acknowledgment that there is a coral reef nearby is often of great appeal for a tourist considering holiday destinations, even if the tourist doesn't actually plan on seeing it!
      Tourism from coral reefs is estimated to produce around $36 billion globally per year.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Coastal Protection</strong><br>
      Coral reefs act as very important barriers against waves and erosion. The reefs can dissipate as much as up to 97% of the incoming wave energy. This is significant because without them, coastal erosion and destruction (including damage to human structures on the coast) would be much higher. 
      It is estimated that without coral reefs, the global cost of damage from coastal erosion would be over $4 billion per year more than it currently is!
                                    </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Other Resources</strong><br>
                                    Reefs also harbour many other substances that are useful or luxurious for humans. Medicine is of particular interest as corals and other reef organisms often have very complex and effective ways of keeping diseases off the reef. 
                                    Stock for building material and the aquarium trade is also often obtained by extraction from the reef, although this can be problematic if not carried out ethically and sustainably.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Cultural significance for many communities</strong><br>
     The reef is of spiritual importance for many cultures, for example for a number of aboriginal communities.  Their livelihood has often been closely tied to the reef for thousands of years and they consider the reef as sacred.                             </p>
    <p>All in all, coral reefs are estimated to produce around <strong>$30 billion per year for the global economy!</strong></p>

  <h2>Reef Structure</h2>
  <p>The reef can be divided into an area called the <strong>reef flat</strong> (the flat inner reef area nearest the shore), the <strong>reef crest</strong> (the top of the area that begins to slope downwards toward the deep) and the <strong>reef slope</strong>.</p>
  <p>The conditions can vary depending on where you are on the reef. This affects the species or the life stages of the organisms that live there. 
  For example, there is a high abundance of juvenile fish and small adult fish species living in the shallows, as they are safer from large predators that don’t have space to swim here. 
  As you descend down the slope, fish are typically likely to get sparser and bigger. 
  The coral and algae may also change as you move down the reef. Different species have different suitability ranges with regards to light intensity or wave intensity.

  <h3>Three Types of Coral Reef</h3>
  <p>On his voyage on the HMS Beagle, Charles Darwin pioneered the distinction of three different formations of coral reef. 
  The formation depends on the age of the reef and the geological activity of the land around it.</p>

                                                                                                                                    <br><br><br>
<img height="100" width="250" align="right" style="padding-left: 40px;" src="fringingReef.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Fringing</strong><br>
                              These lie along the coastline, either coming right up to the shore, or separated from the shore by only a very shallow sand bank.</p>
<br><br><br>
<img height="100" width="250" align="right" style="padding-left: 40px;" src="barrierReef.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Barrier</strong><br>
These used to be fringing reefs, but the land has since sunken away, leaving a large gap between the reef and the new shoreline. Barrier reefs can therefore be several km away from the shore.</p>
<br><br><br>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Atoll</strong><br>
 These used to be fringing reefs that formed around a volcanic island. The volcano has since become inactive and has sunk completely below sea level, while the coral carries on growing upwards. This leaves a ring of coral reef, surrounding a central lagoon of shallow sand.</p>

  <div style="border: solid 2px gray; padding: 0px 35px 10px 35px;">
    <h2>Reef Community Hubs</h2>
    <p>Broadly speaking, we can group tropical coral reef systems into three geographically distinct communities. They are the <strong>Caribbean</strong>, 
      the <strong>Red Sea</strong> and the <strong>Indo-Pacific</strong> reef systems. All three function in very similar ways, however the exact species filling 
    particular a niche may differ depending on what region you are in. However, there are plenty of organisms that may be found in two or all three regions.</p>
              <img height="360" width="660" align="right" style="padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 50px;" src="reefHotspots.jpg">  
    <h3 style="font-size: 19px; padding-left: 30px;">Comparing Diversity</h3>
    <p>The most biodiverse reefs in the world are found in the Indo-Pacific. This is due to a number of reasons.</p> 
      <p>Landmasses provide barriers that make it hard or impossible for marine communities from different ocean basins to mix. However, the Indo-Pacific is situated where the Indian
      and Pacific ocean basins meet. Biological input is therefore coming in from both, overlapping in a region of conveniantly shallow and tropical waters. 
      In contrast, the Red Sea is extremely cut off from other oceanic bodies of water. And the Caribbean receives plenty of input from the Atlantic, but is seiled off 
      from any Pacific input by the Isthmus of Panama (the land-bridge between North and South America).</p>
      <p>Indo-Pacific coral reefs also recieve an optimum amount of disturbance. 
        The Caribbean receives frequent and often severe storms, and this can be harmful to much of the wildlife. 
        In contrast, the Red Sea is very sheltered and therefore receives very little rough weather. 
        Surprisingly, this lack of storms can also limit the biodiversity because a certain degree of stormy weather helps to maintain the balance of nature by preventing certain species from dominating at the expense of others. 
        The Indo-Pacific recieves a 'medium' amount of stormy weather. Not so much that it destroys the marine community. Not so little that species don't easily outcompete one another.</p>
  <p>Within the Indo-Pacific lies a region that is often refered to as the <strong>Coral Triangle</strong>. 
    It includes the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and Solomon Islands. 
    The Coral Triangle is the most biodiverse marine region on the planet and is home to more than 2000 species of fish. 
    It is of great importance to marine science, is a highly desired destination for many passionate SCUBA divers, and is of great importance for the thriving of the 120 million people that live within it.</p>
